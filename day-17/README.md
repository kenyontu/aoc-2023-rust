# Day 17 notes

As a beginner on path finding algorithms I had to make some research on how they work.

Here are some good resources that are essencial to solve this day's problem:

- [How Dijkstra's Algorithm Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFg3u_E6eHU): Video by Spanning Tree on Youtube, it illustrates how the algorithm works step by step.
- [Introductioin to the A\* Algorithm](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html): Post from Red Blob Games, it explains with code how to implement the BFS, Dijkstra and A\* path finding algorithms, I used these algorithms as a base for my solution.
